# Pet-Project---Python-Linear-Solver

## Description

We all know it's possible to create linear solvers in Excel. However, when using Excel everything needs to be done within a GUI which makes it more difficult to use in a production environment. For this purpose, I would like to create a solver in python using framework that already exist for this purpose.

## File Descriptions

* solver.xlsx - contains a dummy problem to be solved
* dat/ - folder containing any data used by python to solve the linear optimisation
* solver.ipynb - Python Notebook containing explanation for the implementation of the linear optimiser

## Project Requirements

This project requires the use of the following python packages:

1. N/A
